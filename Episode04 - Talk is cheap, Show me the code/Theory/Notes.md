# Episode 04 - Talk In Cheap, Show Me The Code

- Before start any app start with planning.
- Create mockup/wireframe of app
- Decide component which will be used in app

### Props - (Property/Argument)

- Passing arguments to a function
- when passing dynamic data to component pass as props

### Config-Driven-UI

- UI is driven by config
- React never use index as key in.

#### Not using keys(not acceptable) <<< index as key <<<<<< unique key(best practice)
